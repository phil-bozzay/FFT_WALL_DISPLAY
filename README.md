## Current Status
STARTING 

## Project Overview

Pick up sound in a room and display the frequencies on a grid of leds.
Front end analog equipment for signal filtering/amplification 
Rasberry pi for signal processing
Shift registers/ LED chips for driving LEDs 

## Educational Value Added
Electronic circuit design and digital signal processing 

## Tasks


## Design Decisions
Addressable LEDs: https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/sparkfun-electronics/16346/11630211
Microphone: INMP441 -> connect directly to the pi 
Signal amplifier: LM381n -> might not be needed
